# Benny-s-Blog
My Personal Blog Built with Flask.

For this blog, I used:

HTMX for dynmaic page-loading.

SQLite3 for the database.

Flask to serve the database and static files.

NGINX as my reverse proxy.

Vultr as my VPS.

I have an admin page I use to post files to the blog's database. It is password-protected to ensure not just anyone can access the blog-post functionality. I did not include it in the repository for security purposes. 

That being said, it is pretty simple to make your own, as it is just a basic html form that communicates with the Flask server.
